# Real-Time-Supply-Chain-Optimization-using-Predictive-Analytics


This project focuses on optimizing supply chains using IoT data, predictive analytics, and machine learning. By forecasting demand and automating inventory management, it helps reduce bottlenecks, prevent stockouts, and minimize costs.

Highlights
IoT Integration: Processed real-time data like stock levels and supplier delays.
Forecasting Models: Used ARIMA and LSTM to predict future demand.
Inventory Optimization: Automated reorder calculations based on forecasts.
Visualization: Developed dashboards to track stock levels and trends.
Technologies
Python: Data processing, forecasting, and optimization.
SQL: Data storage and querying.
Apache Kafka: For real-time data streaming.
Machine Learning: ARIMA, LSTM for predictive analytics.
Dataset
Simulated IoT data with fields:

Date: The date of the record.
Product ID: Unique product identifier.
Daily Demand: Number of units required per day.
Stock Level: Current inventory.
Reorder Level: Minimum threshold for reordering.
Supplier Delay: Expected days for stock delivery.
Learning Outcomes
Handling real-time IoT data for analytics.
Building time-series forecasting models.
Optimizing inventory management for supply chains.
