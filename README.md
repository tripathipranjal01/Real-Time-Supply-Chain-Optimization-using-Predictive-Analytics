# Real-Time-Supply-Chain-Optimization-using-Predictive-Analytics


This project focuses on optimizing supply chains using IoT data, predictive analytics, and machine learning. By forecasting demand and automating inventory management, it helps reduce bottlenecks, prevent stockouts, and minimize costs.

Highlights

- **IoT Integration**: Processed real-time data (e.g., stock levels, supplier delays) for efficient inventory management.
- **Forecasting Models**: Utilized ARIMA and LSTM algorithms to predict future demand and optimize stock levels.
- **Inventory Optimization**: Automated reorder calculations based on demand forecasts to minimize stockouts and overstock.
- **Visualization**: Developed interactive dashboards to monitor stock levels, trends, and forecasting accuracy.
- **Collaboration**: Feel free to connect for questions or collaborations via LinkedIn.

Technologies

- **Python**: Data processing, forecasting, and optimization.
- **SQL**: Data storage and querying.
- **Apache Kafka**: Real-time data streaming for IoT integration.
- **Machine Learning**: ARIMA and LSTM for predictive analytics and demand forecasting.

Hereâ€™s how you can present the dataset and learning outcomes in a concise format for GitHub:

Dataset
- **Date**: The date of the record.
- **Product ID**: Unique product identifier.
- **Daily Demand**: Number of units required per day.
- **Stock Level**: Current inventory.
- **Reorder Level**: Minimum threshold for reordering.
- **Supplier Delay**: Expected days for stock delivery.

Learning Outcomes
- Handling real-time IoT data for analytics.
- Building time-series forecasting models for demand prediction.
- Optimizing inventory management and supply chain operations.
